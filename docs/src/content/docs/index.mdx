title: Kissflow Javascript Client SDK
description: Introduction to KF SDK
---


Welcome to the Kissflow Lowcode JavaScript SDK repository! This SDK empowers
developers to seamlessly interact with the Kissflow low-code platform using
JavaScript.


Within the Kissflow environment, whether in the platform or inside apps, you have built-in support to use these SDKs directly wherever JavaScript events are available. You can access the SDKs using the `kf` namespace. 

Example:

```js
kf.client.showInfo("Welcome " + kf.user.Name);
```
